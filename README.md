# Solarized for Obsidian

This is just a recolor for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) based on [Ethan Schoonover's Solarized color scheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/). Works as of Obsidian 0.6.4.

## How to install

Find this theme in the Obsidian's community themes browser under Settings > Appearance > Themes.

Alternatively, download `obsidian.css` to `.obsidian/themes` in your Vault folder and rename it to `Solarized.css`. Then activate it under Settings > Appearance. (For older versions of Obsidian that do not support themes yet, just place `obsidian.css` in the root of your Vault.)
